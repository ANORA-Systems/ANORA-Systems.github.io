                    As part of our business activities, we work with various external bodies. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external bodies if this is necessary within the framework of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in passing it on pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the transfer of data. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
