                    <p>(1) These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all contracts between Anora Systems (hereinafter "Provider") and its customers (hereinafter "Customer") regarding the use of the software "SpecScout" and related services.</p>
                    <p>(2) The offer is aimed exclusively at Entrepreneurs within the meaning of § 14 of the German Civil Code (BGB), legal entities under public law, or special funds under public law. Conclusion of contracts with consumers is excluded.</p>
                    <p>(3) Deviating, conflicting, or supplementary terms and conditions of the Customer shall only become part of the contract if and to the extent that the Provider has expressly consented to their validity in writing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="agb-section" id="section-2">
                    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-anoraBlue mb-3">2. Subject Matter and Contract Type</h2>
                    <p>(1) The Provider provides the Customer with SpecScout, a software solution for the automated identification, research, extraction, and structuring of technical product data (Software-as-a-Service).</p>
                    <p>(2) The data is provided based on publicly available sources and using automated methods.</p>
                    <p>(3) The Provider performs its services within the framework of a Service Contract (<em>Dienstvertrag</em>). Despite implemented quality assurance measures, no guarantee can be assumed for the complete correctness, timeliness, and completeness of the extracted data – particularly due to the dependence on external data sources.</p>
                    <p>(4) The concrete scope of services (e.g., number of requests, data formats, support level) results from the respective individual contract or offer.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-anoraBlue mb-3">3. Pilot Phase and "Beta" Status</h2>
                    <p>(1) Unless otherwise stated, if the software is marked as "Pilot Phase", "Beta", or "Prototype" in the offer, it is still under development.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Customer expressly acknowledges that:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-3 space-y-1">
                        <li>functions may be restricted or changed at short notice,</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>(3) A warranty for technical freedom from errors is excluded during the Pilot Phase, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
                    <p>(4) During the Pilot Phase, there is no claim to the permanent availability of certain functions, further development of the software, or the adoption of individual functions into a later product version. The Provider is entitled to adjust, remove, or discontinue functions at any time.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>(1) The Customer shall provide all information required for the provision of services in the agreed format.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Customer ensures that the use of the delivered data is legally permissible in their respective area of application. The Provider assumes no obligation to examine the legal admissibility of the data use by the Customer (e.g., with regard to copyright, trademark, competition, product labeling, or consumer protection law).</p>

                    <p>(2) Regarding the delivered datasets (Output), the Provider grants the Customer – to the extent legally possible – a permanent, simple right of use for use in their own business operations (esp. E-Commerce).</p>
                    <p>(3) Any form of reverse engineering, systematic scraping of the API beyond the contractual measure, or misuse of the services to develop competing products is prohibited.</p>
                    <p>(4) The Provider is entitled to use anonymized and aggregated usage and output data for the improvement of the software, for statistical purposes, and for the further development of its own systems.</p>
                    <p>(5) Disclosure of internal operating principles, models, or evaluation mechanisms is excluded.</p>

                    <p>(1) The Provider is liable without limitation for intent, gross negligence, and injury to life, body, or health.</p>
                    <p>(2) In cases of slight negligence, the Provider is only liable for the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations). In this case, liability is limited in amount to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract at the time of conclusion.</p>
                    <p>(3) Strict liability for initial defects (§ 536a BGB) is excluded.</p>
                    <p>(4) Furthermore, the Provider is not liable for:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-3 space-y-1">
                        <li>the content correctness, completeness, or timeliness of the automatically researched product data,</li>

                        <li>economic decisions or measures taken by the Customer based on the provided data (e.g., listing decisions, pricing, marketing statements).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>(5) Liability for lost profits, missed savings, or other indirect consequential damages is excluded.</p>
                    <p>(6) <strong>Indemnification:</strong> The Customer shall indemnify and hold the Provider harmless from all claims by third parties asserted against the Provider due to unlawful or contract-breaching use of the provided data by the Customer.

                    <p>(1) The Provider is entitled to change these GTC with effect for the future for objective reasons (e.g., changes in law, technical developments, adjustment of the scope of services).</p>
                    <p>(2) Changes will be communicated to the Customer in text form at least six weeks before they take effect.</p>
                    <p>(3) If the Customer does not object within this period, the changes are deemed accepted. If the Customer objects, the Provider is entitled to terminate the contract in an orderly manner at the time the changes take effect.</p>
